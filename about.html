<p>Michael John Stevens goes by many names. Blizzerd, Blizz, Snowball, The Ice King. No matter which way we decide to put it, it does     <br>
		<br>
		not change who he is. A man. A man who has found love in art and culture. To say these things helped him grow would be an understatement.
		<br>
		<br>
		 He has such a passion for them, and he cannot stick to just one facet. He enjoys rapping and singing, as well as poetry. Words have been his saving grace many a times.
		<br>
		<br>
		He also loves taking photos or films of the beautiful elements Mother Earth has to offer. I know you may be thinking, how do I know so much
